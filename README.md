## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Vite build tool

### What I learned

This was harder than expected. Working with states, operators, keys and making everything synchronized and responsive made me rethink about the way i code. This will help a lot in the future

### Continued development

I still don't know much about Hooks and i will work on them in future projects
